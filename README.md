## üöÄ Download & Installation (Recommended)

Get the latest standalone application for your operating system. No Python installation required!

1.  Go to the [**Releases Page**](https://github.com/KnowOneActual/python-image-processor/releases).
2.  Download the latest version for your operating system (e.g., `image-processor. macOS.app.zip` or `image-processor. WIN.app.zip`).
3.  Unzip the file if necessary and place the application in a convenient location.

### Running the Application

* **On Windows:** Double-click the `.exe` file.
* **On macOS:**
    1.  Double-click the application. You will likely see a warning that says the app cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.
    2.  Click **OK** to close the warning.
    3.  Go to **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security**.
    4.  Scroll down to the "Security" section. You will see a message about the application being blocked.
    5.  Click the **"Open Anyway"** button. You will only need to do this the first time you run the app.

## ‚ú® Features

This tool's features aim to help make your image workflow faster and more efficient:

* **Desktop GUI Application**: An intuitive and modern interface that's easy for anyone to use.
* **Bulk Processing**: Process entire folders of images at once.
* **Format Conversion**: Convert between `jpeg`, `png`, `webp`, and `gif`.
* **Resizing**: Scale images to a specific width while maintaining the aspect ratio.
* **Center Cropping**: Crop images to a specific aspect ratio (e.g., `16:9`, `1:1`).
* **Watermarking**: Add a customizable text watermark to your images.
* **Quality Control**: Adjust the compression quality for `jpeg` and `webp` files to balance file size and quality.
